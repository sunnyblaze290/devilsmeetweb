    <h2>Advertising Options to Reach ASU Students: Campus Avenues vs. Devils Meet</h2>
<p>Local businesses in Tempe have several ways to promote themselves to Arizona State University (ASU) students. Below we examine traditional on-campus advertising options – from pop-up booths to banners and flyers – including recent pricing (2023–2025) and typical reach. We then compare these with digital avenues and ultimately show why Devils Meet, an ASU-exclusive platform, offers significantly better value, targeted reach, and ROI for reaching the Sun Devil student community.</p>
<h2>Pop-Up Shops and On-Campus Booths</h2>
<p>Overview: Many local businesses try to reach students by setting up a table or pop-up shop on ASU’s Tempe campus. ASU permits Non-University Organizations (NUOs) to do this, but there is a formal process, cost, and limit on frequency.</p>
<p>Coordination & Requirements: An outside business must be sponsored by a Registered Student Organization (RSO) and register each semester with ASU’s Event & Meeting Services office​
. The business must carry liability insurance and obtain city/state permits (sales tax license, etc.)​
​
. Importantly, ASU had paused new vendor reservations as of late 2024​
, meaning opportunities for new businesses to table have been temporarily on hold.</p>
<p>Pricing: The required costs include a $200 per semester registration fee ($100 for nonprofits)​
, plus a daily fee paid to the sponsoring student group of $125–$175 per day for each day you set up on the “mall” (the campus promenade)​
. Certain high-traffic dates or locations have higher fees​
. In practice, a local business might spend ~$200 (registration) + ~$625 (5 days at $125) per semester for the maximum 5 days allowed.</p>
<p>Limits & Duration: Vendors are limited to 5 days per semester on campus​
​
. Each day’s operation is typically limited to a standard period (often about 4 hours is the norm for tabling)​
. This limited duration means you have to pick your days/times (usually midday when foot traffic is highest).</p>
<p>Reach and Engagement: ASU’s Tempe campus has over 56,000 students enrolled in person​
, and popular pedestrian areas like Cady Mall or the Memorial Union plaza see thousands of passersby daily. However, engaging students at a booth is hit-or-miss. Even on a busy day, a vendor might only directly interact with a few dozen to a couple hundred students who stop at the table. (For example, businesses often attract students by handing out freebies or samples – one might give away 200 samples in an afternoon to draw interest). Thus, while foot traffic is high, the conversion rate (students who actually talk, sign up, or buy) is relatively low. It’s not uncommon that out of the hundreds who walk by, only a small percentage engage meaningfully. Those who do stop are often attracted by swag or free food, which is an additional cost to the business.</p>
<p>Pros: Face-to-face interaction can create personal connections. You can physically demonstrate or sample a product. Students who engage might convert on the spot (e.g. sign up for a service, follow on social media, or make a purchase).</p>
<p>Cons: The cost per day is relatively high (hundreds of dollars when including fees and materials) given the limited reach. There’s significant effort in setup and manning the table. Bureaucracy is involved – you must coordinate with a student org sponsor and follow university rules strictly. If paperwork or approvals aren’t done 2+ weeks in advance, you can’t participate​
. And with the recent pause on outside vendors​
, new businesses may not even get this opportunity. Even when allowed, you are only reaching whoever happens to walk by; you cannot specifically target which students see your booth beyond picking a busy location.</p>
<p>Bottom line: On-campus pop-up booths can yield some student engagement but involve hefty fees and logistics for limited exposure. At best, a business might reach a few hundred students in a day of tabling, after spending around $300 (fees + materials) – easily $1–$2 per actual student interaction, not counting the value of time spent. This is a relatively high cost for a small slice of the ASU population.

Physical Campus Banners and Signage</p>
<p>Overview: Another way to get visibility is through physical signage on or around campus – for example, banners hung in student areas or signage on campus kiosks and boards. However, at ASU these opportunities for outside businesses are quite limited and often expensive.</p>
<p>On-Campus Banners (University Coordination): ASU tightly controls on-campus signage. External advertising is generally not allowed on campus property unless it’s part of a university-sponsored event or initiative​
. The ASU Brand Guide makes clear that campus banner frames and light poles are reserved for university messages (like ASU events, walk-only zones, etc.), not commercial ads for outside companies​
​
. For example, the Tempe campus Memorial Union has a few banner stands, but they can only be reserved by ASU departments for their event promotion​
​
.</p>
<p>Costs (on campus): Even when a banner is approved for an ASU event, the costs hint at how expensive such signage is. A large banner at Fulton Center (an ASU admin building) runs about $1,700 just for printing and installation​
. While a local business wouldn’t be able to buy that directly, this figure gives a sense of scale – large-format signage on campus is a multi-thousand-dollar endeavor. The Memorial Union charges at least a $25 hanging fee even for internal groups using banner space​
. If an outside business somehow partnered on a banner, they’d likely bear those production costs. In short, true on-campus banners are effectively off-limits or cost-prohibitive for local businesses.</p>
<p>Near-Campus Signage (Third-Party): The alternative is to advertise just off campus. For instance, the city of Tempe’s public light poles around campus (on Mill Avenue, University Drive, etc.) sometimes display banners. Those are controlled by third-party media organizations in partnership with the city or Downtown Tempe Authority, not directly by ASU​
. A local business can purchase this kind of banner by working through those vendors (ASU’s Outreach Hub can connect departments to them for “best rates”​
). The pricing for downtown Tempe lamppost banners typically includes printing each banner and a rental fee for a set period (often on the order of hundreds of dollars per banner, per month in similar markets). For example, sponsoring a series of street banners during a downtown event might cost a business $2,000+ for a short-term campaign.</p>
<p>Exposure: Physical banners do get seen – a prominently placed banner near the Memorial Union or along a busy street by campus can theoretically have tens of thousands of impressions. With ~56k students on Tempe campus plus faculty/staff, a banner in a high-traffic spot could easily be viewed by a few thousand students each day​
. If it’s up for two weeks, that could be tens of thousands of cumulative views. However, those impressions are very passive. A student walking by might glance at a banner for a second or not notice it at all. There’s no guarantee they absorb the message, and there’s no interactivity. It’s pure brand awareness, unlike a booth where you can talk to the student.</p>
<p>Limitations: As noted, ASU prohibits commercial signage on campus except via official channels​
, so a local business usually cannot just hang a banner on a campus building or lawn. Any guerrilla attempt (like hanging flyers on campus light poles or walls) violates posting policies and they’ll be removed promptly by campus staff. Thus, the only viable banner option is off-campus (city property) or through student media poster displays (discussed below). Both involve cost and coordination with either city permit or ASU media offices.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Physical banners/signs can provide broad visibility but come with high costs and red tape, and very limited targeting. You might pay thousands for a banner that every student walks past, yet there’s no way to ensure any particular segment of students (say, your target customers) pay attention. For a small local business, this route is often not cost-effective. Devils Meet, by contrast, can display your message repeatedly in students’ app feeds or notifications at far less cost, with certainty that the audience is ASU students (more on that soon).



Flyers, Chalking, and Local Influencer Promotions</p>
<p>Local businesses also employ grassroots tactics to reach students. Common approaches include distributing flyers on or near campus, chalking sidewalks with promotional messages, or partnering with student influencers to spread the word. These methods have low monetary cost but varying effectiveness and limitations.</p>
<p>Flyer Distribution: Printing up a stack of flyers or coupons and handing them out near campus is a tried-and-true method. The cost is relatively low (for example, 1,000 one-page flyers might cost ~$50–$100 to print). Some businesses stand on the public sidewalks at ASU edges or near the Tempe campus dorms to hand out flyers, or they post them on community bulletin boards in student hangouts. Effectiveness is questionable, however. Many students reflexively avoid or trash handouts – campus is saturated with paper. ASU’s policy requires that any on-campus distribution of literature by non-ASU parties be in designated areas with approval​
. In fact, soliciting or posting on campus without permission is prohibited​
. So businesses often restrict flyer handouts to just off campus (e.g. on the sidewalk along College Ave, or at events). You might reach a lot of students this way, but it’s untargeted – you’re essentially hoping whoever accepts the flyer is interested. There’s no feedback or analytics. The conversion rate from random flyer to paying customer is typically very low, often well below 5%.</p>
<p>Chalk Marketing: Writing promotional messages in chalk on sidewalks near student areas can grab attention in a creative way. Students do notice colorful chalk messages on the ground advertising an event or special. The great advantage is it costs almost nothing (a box of chalk and some artistry). However, ASU strictly regulates chalking on campus. Only official ASU entities (like student clubs) can chalk on certain approved concrete areas, and they must get advance approval and even schedule removal with Facilities Management​
​
. Chalking by an outside business would not be approved (non-ASU entities are not allowed to chalk campus at all​
). If done guerrilla-style, it may be washed away promptly or result in a fine. Off campus sidewalks (city property) might be a gray area; a business might chalk a message on the city sidewalk along Apache or Mill Avenue, but city codes often consider that graffiti unless it’s a permitted event. So, while chalk marketing has been used (e.g. clubs chalking messages like “$5 pizza at X tonight!” near the MU), it’s not a reliable or scalable tactic for businesses. It’s also temporary – one rain or campus cleaning, and it’s gone. In summary, chalking is eye-catching but very limited in reach (only those who walk over that exact spot, within a short time window) and generally not allowed for off-campus promos.</p>
<p>Local Influencer Partnerships: A more modern tactic is leveraging student influencers or ambassadors. ASU has many students with sizable social media followings (thousands of followers on Instagram, TikTok, etc.), often focused on college life, food, or fashion. A local business (for example, a new boba tea shop) might invite a few known student influencers for a free tasting in exchange for them posting about it. The idea is to get a credible peer voice to promote your brand. Some students even act as paid campus ambassadors for brands – essentially micro-influencers who spread word-of-mouth. The reach of this strategy can be decent: a popular ASU micro-influencer might have 5,000–10,000 followers, mostly fellow students​
, and their post could get a few thousand views. This is more targeted than random advertising because their followers are likely ASU peers. Cost can range from just giving free product to paying a fee ($50-$200 per post for a micro-influencer is not uncommon, though some might promote in exchange for perks).</p>
<p>Pros: Influencer content can be persuasive because it’s coming from a peer that students trust. It also lives on social media where it can be shared or viewed on demand, extending its life beyond a one-day event.</p>
<p>Cons: You are still reaching a fraction of the student body. Even 10k followers is about 1/5 of Tempe’s students, and many followers might not be ASU students (could be friends from back home, bots, etc.). Engagement isn’t guaranteed – students might skip over sponsored-looking posts. And managing multiple influencers or an ambassador program takes effort.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Grassroots methods like flyers and chalk are low-cost but scattershot, often requiring physical effort for minimal return. Influencer marketing can target students more authentically, but its scale is limited by the influencer’s audience and can involve hidden costs (free product, commissions, etc.). These tactics might supplement a marketing campaign, but on their own they often fall short in reaching a broad student audience reliably.</p>
<p>In contrast, Devils Meet can combine the peer reach of an influencer (since it’s a platform where students engage) with the scale of a broader network (reaching many thousands of students in-app without needing individual handouts). And it does so in a controlled, measurable way.</p>
<h2>Digital Advertising vs. Campus Channels</h2>
<p>(If considering generic digital ads): One might consider simply running Google Ads or social media ads targeted to ASU students. Platforms like Google, Facebook/Instagram, or Snapchat allow geographic and demographic targeting – for example, you could geofence a 2-mile radius around campus or target ages 18-24 in Tempe. This can indeed reach students online. However, there are a few issues:</p>
<p>Cost and Waste: Digital ad pricing works typically on a cost-per-click or per-impression basis. To reach, say, 10,000 impressions among students, you might spend on the order of $50–$100 (assuming a ~$5-10 CPM for local targeted social ads). But not all those 10,000 impressions are guaranteed to be ASU students – some could be locals in the area or older graduate students who might not be your target customers, etc. Even interest-based targeting (like “college life” or “ASU” on Facebook) isn’t perfect. There’s always waste in broad digital targeting – you pay for some eyeballs that aren’t relevant. In contrast, on Devils Meet every single user is an ASU student by design, so 100% of your impressions are hitting actual Sun Devils.</p>
<p>Attention and Engagement: Students are bombarded with online ads and often scroll past them. Unless the ad is extremely compelling, it may get ignored (the classic “banner blindness”). On Devils Meet, any sponsored content or promotion appears within a context exclusively dedicated to the ASU community, likely making it feel more like a relevant announcement than a random ad. This can lead to higher engagement.</p>
<p>Targeting Specific Campus Segments: Google/Facebook can’t inherently know who is an ASU student (they can approximate via location or if someone lists ASU in their profile, but it’s not exact). Devils Meet inherently knows its user base (registered .edu emails or similar for access), so if a local business wants to, for example, target only students on the Tempe campus or only undergraduates, Devils Meet could offer that precision. Traditional digital platforms can’t match that specificity without third-party data.</p>
<p>In short, standard digital ads are broad and can be moderately costly for what you get. They only make sense if Devils Meet’s solution did not exist. But given Devils Meet’s focused network, it offers a much clearer line to the student audience without the noise and waste of other digital channels.</p>
<h2>The Devils Meet Advantage: Value, Reach & Targeting</h2>
<p>Devils Meet is a mobile application designed by ASU students exclusively for ASU students​</p>
<p>. This exclusivity is key – it means any promotion through Devils Meet is automatically targeting enrolled ASU students, and no one else. Here’s a breakdown of why Devils Meet offers significantly better value, reach, and targeting for local businesses:</p>
<p>Direct Reach into the Student Community: Unlike a physical banner or a random Instagram ad, a post on Devils Meet is seen in an environment for students, by students. If Devils Meet has, say, tens of thousands of ASU student users (which is likely given it’s open to all ASU and marketed as a way for students to connect), then a single announcement or featured post can potentially reach a huge portion of the student body very quickly. For example, if 10,000 students use the app daily, a promotion on Devils Meet could get 10k impressions in a day, something that would take many days of handing out flyers or a fortune spent on ads to achieve otherwise. And those impressions are all students (no outsiders).</p>
<p>High Engagement and Conversion Potential: Because the app is built for students to find useful info (study partners, events, etc.), students are in a mindset to discover on Devils Meet. They might be more receptive to a deal or event from a local business when it’s presented alongside other campus-related content. This is a more targeted context than shouting in the crowded social media world. A compelling offer on Devils Meet (e.g. “Show this in-app coupon for 20% off at Joe’s Coffee for ASU students”) can immediately drive foot traffic. The conversion can even be tracked if Devils Meet provides interaction stats or coupon usage data. In contrast, if you hang a banner, you never really know how many people saw or acted on it.</p>
<p>Cost-Effectiveness: Devils Meet offers a far better bang for your buck. To illustrate this, consider the following comparison of channels:</p>
<p>Table: Rough comparison of promotional channels for reaching ASU Tempe students.

 As the table suggests, Devils Meet can deliver thousands of targeted impressions at a fraction of the cost of other methods. For example, for what it costs to do one day of tabling (~$300), a business could potentially run a sustained campaign on Devils Meet for multiple days or weeks. The cost per student reached on Devils Meet is dramatically lower because there’s little to no “waste” – you’re not paying for non-students. Even compared to social media ads, Devils Meet is more efficient: you might pay pennies per student reached on Devils Meet versus dimes on broader platforms, simply because of targeting efficiency. (Note: Devils Meet’s specific pricing may vary, but given it’s a platform dedicated to the campus community, it is priced accessibly for local businesses, especially when compared to physical advertising costs.)</p>
<p>Measurable Impact: Devils Meet can  provide metrics – e.g. how many students viewed or clicked your promotion, how many claimed a deal, etc. This data is invaluable. Traditional campus advertising gives you no clear feedback (you can only guess if your banner worked or how many people you reached handing out flyers). With Devils Meet, a business can actually see the reach and engagement numbers and refine their campaign (much like digital ads but with a student focus). If 500 students saved your coupon in Devils Meet, that’s 500 leads you can expect, and you’ll know exactly what your conversion funnel looks like.</p>
<p>Agility and Ease: Setting up a promotion on Devils Meet is as simple as a few taps on the website or an email to the platform’s ad team – far easier than the weeks of paperwork for on-campus booths or banner permits. Need to promote a special just for ASU students next week? On Devils Meet you could push that out almost instantly, whereas traditional methods would be too slow or cumbersome. The speed and flexibility allow businesses to be responsive (for instance, promoting a deal during finals week specifically to relieve student stress, timed perfectly).</p>
<p>Exclusivity and Student Goodwill: Students appreciate deals/opportunities that feel tailor-made for them. By advertising on Devils Meet, a business is implicitly saying “We’re focusing on ASU students.” This can build goodwill and word-of-mouth. It’s akin to being inside the community versus an outsider trying to get in. Google Ads might reach them, but it still feels like an ad. A Devils Meet post feels like part of the campus conversation. That can enhance trust and receptiveness, leading to higher conversion rates than other channels.

In summary, Devils Meet stands out by delivering better value, greater reach, and pinpoint targeting for local marketing to ASU students. It combines the best aspects of digital marketing (measurable, broad reach, low cost per impression) with the relevance of on-campus efforts (hitting the exact population you want, in a context that’s all about campus life).</p>
<p>For a local business in Tempe, the case is clear: why spend $1,000 on a one-time banner or a couple days of tabling – reaching at best a sliver of the students – when for a fraction of that you could continuously engage thousands of Sun Devils through Devils Meet? By leveraging Devils Meet, businesses get significantly more “bang for their buck” and can build a sustained presence with ASU students, translating to more foot traffic, sales, and student loyalty. It’s the smart, 21st-century way to tap into the ASU market, handily outperforming the old-school methods in both cost efficiency and results.</p>
